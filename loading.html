  <h1>Loading AwsSum</h1>

  <p>
    After installing AwsSum, you are now able to load it into your programs ready for use. So that the entire suite of
    AwsSum libraries aren't loaded, you just load the base package and then any others you required. For example, to
    load Amazon S3 you always load AwsSum and the Amazon package (so that we can get at some constants defined there) :
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var awssum = require('awssum');
var amazon = awssum.load('amazon/amazon');
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    and in this example only the S3 package:
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var S3 = awssum.load('amazon/s3').S3;
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    From there it's a case of creating a new object for this service using your own credentials. Each service might be
    slightly different so look at the docs for creating each object. Here is an example using Amazon S3:
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var s3 = new S3({
    'accessKeyId' : accessKeyId,
    'secretAccessKey' : secretAccessKey,
    'region' : amazon.US_EAST_1
});
{% endhighlight %}
